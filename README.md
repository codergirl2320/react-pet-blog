Because of COVID-19, all of our favorite "Secret Life of Pets" character’s humans are home - ALL DAY - preventing them from doing ALL the activities they normally enjoy while their owners work…not to mention sneaking out to see each other. And they are NOT happy about it! So they decided to start a blog to communicate - and COMPLAIN…

## Stretch Goals We Tried

* *Routing Stretch Goal*
  * Reshae: Just type whatever you want to say here...
  
  
* *Moment.js Stretch Goal*
  * Stephen: Just type whatever you want to say here...
  
 (EXAMPLE OF WHAT I SAID IF IT HELPS...
  "Added timestamps and tried for many hours to get Moment.js to convert them. But even with Dan's help, I wasn't able to 
  get there. The best I got was getting the "createdAt" time (created by the timestamp) to appear on the page...but as 
  we know, that's not very human friendly.")
