GOTTA LOVE HAMSTER LIFE...

COVID-19 IS WORKING OUT GREAT FOR ME! ALL MY HUMANS ARE HOME AND ENTERTAINING ME AROUND THE CLOCK...I GO FROM A/C VENT TO A/C VENT WATCHING THEIR ANTICS...THERE'S COOKING IN THE KITCHEN...A TALE OF KNIGHTS IN THE KID'S ROOM...HILARIOUS MAN CONVERSATION IN THE LIVING ROOM...REALLY HOPE IT NEVER ENDS!

SEEING MY TRUE LOVE MAX LATER...

SO I'VE TREATED MYSELF TO A SPA DAY...GOT EXTRA FLUFFY IN AN EARLY MORNING WASH CYCLE IN THE DISHWASHER...RESTED WITH CUCUMBER SLICES ON MY PUFFY EYES...AND CHEWED A FEW MILK BONES TO CLEAN MY TEETH...

When are they gonna go back to work??

My humans are driving me crazy! When is COVID-19 gonna end?? I'm stuck in this cage all day while THEY have the nerve to complain about being 'bored' and 'trapped' in an 800 sq ft apartment! Are you kidding me? I want to play my video games, but I'm just sitting in here looking at myself in the mirror...ugh!
