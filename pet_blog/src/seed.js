GOTTA LOVE HAMSTER LIFE...

COVID-19 is working out great for ME! All my humans are home and entertaining me around the clock...I go from a/c vent to a/c vent watching their antics...there's cooking in the kitchen...a tale of knights in the kid's room...and hilarious man conversation in the living room...REALLY hope it never ends!

At least I can SEE Max from my window...

It's the only way I'm sane. My true love, Max...across the alley...so happy his human is home all the time. But I want to see him! Why doesn't he miss me???

When are they gonna go back to work??

My humans are driving me crazy! When is COVID-19 gonna end?? I'm stuck in this cage all day while THEY have the nerve to complain about being 'bored' and 'trapped' in an 800 sq ft apartment! Are you kidding me? I want to play my video games, but I'm just sitting in here looking at myself in the mirror...ugh!

Max

I love my human!

She's home ALL the time...it's so awesome! I don't have to stare at the door all day! I could really do without the lampshade around my neck though...

Chloe

I'm wasting away over here...

When will the humans GO AWAY?!? How am I supposed to get ANY decent food around here if I can't get into the fridge?? No roasted turkey...no birthday cake...just that dry, awful cat food. I'm gonna go puke up a furball on his bed...see if I can get my message across...

I need my mixer!!

Just laying here...staring at the stand mixer...taunted by the memory of how amazing it feels rubbing up and down my back...up and down...up and down. OMG...GO BACK TO WORK HUMANS!!!!
